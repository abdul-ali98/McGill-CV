# This is a program meant to help McGill students quickly create CV's without the usual stress of formatting and prioritizing elements to fit on a page.

We folled the MVC framework as described below.

### View
In this case, this is the entire android-studio project, which is designed for mobile.

### Controller
The brains of the program are found the in the controller, as it is what transforms the input data from the UI into a finalized CV. 
The controller can be found here: /McGillCv/app/src/main/java/com/mcgill/mcgillcv/controller/Generate.java

### Model
The model is where the class diagram (domain model is stored): C:\Users\fyren\OneDrive\Documents\MCGILL\CodeJam\cv2.0\McGill-CV\app\src\main\java\com\mcgill\mcgillcv\model
